# Jogging Tracker RESTful API
This ASP.NET Core 6 project provides a RESTful API for tracking jogging times of users. It allows users to create an account, log in, and log out. Once logged in, users can view, edit, and delete their own jogging time entries. There are three roles implemented with different permission levels: a regular user, a user manager, and an admin. Regular users can only CRUD their own records, user managers can CRUD users, and admins can CRUD all records and users. Each jogging time entry includes a date, distance, and time. The API also allows filtering by dates and generating reports on average speed and distance per week.

# Toolkit Requirements
  This project uses the following toolkit:

    -Backend web framework: .NET Core 6
# Usage
  To use this API, you can either build and run the project on your local machine or deploy it to a server. Once the API is up and running, you can use a REST client like Postman or Swagger to interact with it.

# Default Users
  To make it easier for you to test the API, we have created some default users for you. You can use the following credentials to log in to the API:

    - Admin:
    Username: admin
    Password: P@ssw0rd
    - User Manager:
    Username: usermanager
    Password: P@ssw0rd
    - Regular User:
    Username: regularuser
    Password: P@ssw0rd
